        <h2>What is Te Wai-o-Tāne?</h2>
        <p><strong>Te Wai-o-Tāne</strong> means "The Waters of Tāne". In Māori tradition, Tāne Mahuta is the atua (god) of forests and birds, and a guardian of all living things. Water, or <em>wai</em>, is seen as the source of life – flowing through the land, nourishing the forests, and connecting all living beings.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <em>Wai is considered a taonga (treasure) and has its own mauri (life force).</em>

        <h2>The Cultural Importance of Wai and Tāne</h2>
        <p>In Māori worldview, water is not simply a physical resource – it is a living entity with its own whakapapa (genealogy). Rivers, springs, and lakes are connected to iwi and hapū identity. They are places for gathering kai (food), conducting rituals, and passing down stories.</p>
        <p>Tāne Mahuta brought life to the forests after separating Ranginui (Sky Father) and Papatūānuku (Earth Mother). The wai flowing through his domain gives sustenance to every plant and creature, symbolising harmony between the spiritual and physical worlds.</p>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Kaitiakitanga</strong> – guardianship – is a key value in caring for wai and the ngahere (forest), ensuring their health for future generations.
